# Social Network Analysis with NetworkX

This project involves analyzing a social network dataset using the NetworkX library in Python. It focuses on measuring the degree of centrality in a graph at different time intervals, identifying influential nodes, and visualizing the results.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install networkx matplotlib

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git

2. Change the working directory to the project folder:

cd your-repository

You should have a dataset file `fb-messages.edges` in the project folder. You can replace this file with your own dataset.

## Running the Code

You can run the Python script in the project folder to analyze the social network. Modify the script if needed to adapt it to your dataset.

```python
python code.py

The script reads the dataset, calculates degree centrality, and visualizes the graphs at different time intervals.

Results
The project provides visualizations and degree centrality measurements for the social network at different time intervals. It also identifies and visualizes influential nodes in the network.
